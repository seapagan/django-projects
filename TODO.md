# TODO List

- add an optional priority (integer)field to the projects database. With this,
  all projects thasts have this will be sorted by the priority and the remaining
  projects will be then sorted by creation date as usual.
- add buttons to 'show more' so that say only the first 6 projects are shown
  originally until the 'show more' button is pressed and all are shown. Possibly
  add pagination if the number of projects is very large, or on smaller screens?
- if all social media usernames are blank, the 'Connect with Me' should not be
  shown in the About section
