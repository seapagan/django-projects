# TODO List

- Migrate the 'GitHub stats' table to just be in the Projects table. There is
  really not a good reason to keep them separate any more. Show these as
  read-only on the project detail page too.
- the custom error pages also need the js_file context otherwise wont mirror the
  chosen theme
- the about sections should be configurable from the database too
