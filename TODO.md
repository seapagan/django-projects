# TODO List

- Migrate the 'GitHub stats' table to just be in the Projects table. There is
  really not a good reason to keep them separate any more. Show these as
  read-only on the project detail page too.
- add custom 400, 403, 404, 500 etc pages. See [Django
  Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/http/views/#customizing-error-views)
- make the about sections customizable from the database
