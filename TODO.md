# TODO List

## Firm Ideas

- Nothing right now :D

## Future Plans

- add an optional built-in blog to the pages. This would be a separate django
  application inside the main project.

## Possible Ideas

- Migrate the 'GitHub stats' table to just be in the Projects table. There is
  really not a good reason to keep them separate any more. Show these as
  read-only on the project detail page too. [`Maybe not. the current way keeps
  it clean and makes it clear when they expire time-wise. Otheriwse it would
  need a 'stats-updated' field on the main project model too.`]
